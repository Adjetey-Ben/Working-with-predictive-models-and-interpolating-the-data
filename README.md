This project focuses on predicting rainfall patterns in Ghana using two emission scenarios: SSP170 (representing low emissions) and SSP370 (representing high emissions). Leveraging advanced interpolation techniques, we've visualized how rainfall distribution may vary across the region under these scenarios. Our analyses aim to provide valuable insights into the potential impacts of climate change on Ghana's water resources and agriculture. Explore our data and visualizations to understand the contrasting futures these emission scenarios may entail for rainfall in Ghana
